## üåü Why Eden?

Many new players join our game, play briefly, and leave‚Äîoften because essential content is locked behind joining a faction, which requires joining a Discord server and speaking to a community leader. This process is especially difficult for non-English speakers, creating a barrier to entry and limiting our community's growth.

The Eden Game Website solves this by providing the necessary infrastructure to bring community features directly to the player, wherever they are:

- Players can link their roblox accounts to their discord accounts, and make roblox actions without having to be in-game.

- Players can join factions and access content with a single click, no matter their language or location.
- The web service localizes content and removes the need for manual approval or Discord-only onboarding.
- Community management is unified across in-game, Discord, and web platforms.

With Eden, onboarding is fast and accessible, community leaders can manage groups from anywhere, and players enjoy a seamless, cross-platform experience. Eden breaks down platform barriers, making it easy for everyone to join, participate, and thrive.

## üîÑ Architecture Flow
1. User authenticates with Discord OAuth 2.0
2. Backend securely stores Discord tokens and user information
3. User can then link their Roblox account through Roblox OAuth
4. System maintains persistent links between accounts with secure session management
5. User can seamlessly log in with Discord and retain their Roblox account link

## üìä Performance
- Authentication operations complete in under 500ms
- Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- Token refresh operations handled asynchronously to prevent user experience disruption

## üîë Key Achievements
- Implemented complete bidirectional OAuth flows between two major platforms
- Created a secure, persistent user identity system with proper database design
- Developed an intuitive UI for managing cross-platform identities
- Established secure session management with proper encryption and cookie handling
- Built with scalability in mind to handle growing user base

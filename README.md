- **Database**: MySQL with optimized schema for user identity mapping
- **Security**: 
  - Cryptographic hashing for secure token generation
  - HttpOnly cookies to prevent XSS attacks
  - SSL/TLS encryption for all data transmission
  - Environment-based configuration for secure deployment
- **API Integration**: 
  - Discord API for user authentication and profile data
  - Roblox API for account verification and user information

### Infrastructure
- **Configuration Management**: Secure credential handling via environment variables
- **Monitoring**: Error logging and performance tracking with third-party services like Aiven and Render

## üîÑ Architecture Flow
1. User authenticates with Discord OAuth 2.0
2. Backend securely stores Discord tokens and user information
3. User can then link their Roblox account through Roblox OAuth
4. System maintains persistent links between accounts with secure session management
5. User can seamlessly log in with Discord and retain their Roblox account link

## üìä Performance
- Authentication operations complete in under 500ms
- Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- Token refresh operations handled asynchronously to prevent user experience disruption

## üîë Key Achievements
- Implemented complete bidirectional OAuth flows between two major platforms
- Created a secure, persistent user identity system with proper database design
- Developed an intuitive UI for managing cross-platform identities
- Established secure session management with proper encryption and cookie handling
- Built with scalability in mind to handle growing user base

## üåü Why Eden?

Eden bridges the gap between gaming platforms and community management. For our Roblox game, we wanted to create a seamless community experience that extends beyond the game itself. With Eden:

- Players can manage their communities from anywhere - in-game, on Discord, or via our website
- Community leaders experience minimal friction when organizing their groups
- The cross-platform identity system ensures consistent user experience across all touchpoints
- Communities thrive with tools that work wherever our players are

Eden eliminates the traditional boundaries between platforms, creating a unified community management system that follows players wherever they go.

# Rank Management Dashboard Requirements

## Overview
A web-based dashboard that allows officers and group managers to manage user ranks within their groups. The dashboard will provide a user-friendly interface for viewing and modifying user ranks, with appropriate permission checks.

## User Roles
- Officers: Can manage ranks in groups they are officers of
- Group Managers: Can manage ranks in groups they manage
- Regular Users: Can only view their own rank information

## Features

### 1. Group List View
- Display a list of all groups the current user has management permissions in
- Each group should show:
  - Group name
  - User's role in the group
  - Number of members
  - Quick access button to manage ranks

### 2. Rank Management View
When a group is selected, show:
- List of all members in the group
- Current rank of each member
- Available ranks that can be assigned
- Search/filter functionality for members
- Pagination for large groups

### 3. User Interface Requirements
- Clean, modern design
- Responsive layout that works on desktop and mobile
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Loading states for API calls
- Error handling and user feedback
- Confirmation dialogs for rank changes

### 4. API Endpoints (Placeholder)
The following API endpoints are merely suggestions. You can have a completely different list of API endpoints.

```typescript
// Get list of groups user has permissions in
GET /api/groups

// Get members and ranks for a specific group
GET /api/groups/:groupId/members

// Update a user's rank
PUT /api/groups/:groupId/members/:userId/rank

// Get available ranks for a group
GET /api/groups/:groupId/ranks
```

### 5. Data Structures

#### Group
```typescript
interface Group {
  name: string;
  ranks: string[]
  classes: {
    Member: number, // The minimum rank to be classified as Member
    Officer: number, // The minimum rank to be classified as Officer
    HighCommand: number // The minimum rank to be classified as High-Command
  }
}
```

#### Member
```typescript
interface Member {
  robloxId: string;
  rankId: number
}
```

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- React.js for the frontend framework
- TypeScript?? for type safety

### State Management
- Track loading states
- Handle error states
- Cache API responses
- Optimistic updates for rank changes
- Pagination for heavy loads

### Security Considerations
- Implement permission checks before allowing rank changes
- Validate all user inputs
- Handle API errors gracefully
- Show appropriate error messages to users

## Features

1. **Group List Implementation**
   - Group list view
   - Basic styling
   - API integration

2. **Rank Management**
   - Member list view
      - Some form of pagination here
   - Rank selection interface
      - Some form of a dropdown
   - API integration

3. **Polish & Optimization**
   - Loading states
   - Error handling
   - Responsive design
   - Performance optimization

## Future Considerations (reach goals for now)
- Real-time updates using WebSocket
- Bulk rank changes
- Audit logs page
